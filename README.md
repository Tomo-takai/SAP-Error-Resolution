Architecture Overview
The SAP Error Resolution Assistant is built with a modular architecture designed for reliability and extensibility:

User Interface Layer (Streamlit):

Handles user input collection and result presentation
Manages session state and user preferences
Provides intuitive navigation through tabs


API Integration Layer:

Manages communication with the Groq API
Handles authentication and request formatting
Implements error handling and retry logic


Business Logic Layer:

Processes SAP error information
Constructs optimized prompts for the AI model
Parses and validates API responses


Data Processing Layer:

Extracts structured data from API responses
Recovers useful information from malformed responses
Transforms raw data into user-friendly formats



This layered architecture ensures separation of concerns while providing a robust foundation for future enhancements.
Troubleshooting
Common Issues and Solutions
API Connection Errors

Problem: Unable to connect to the Groq API
Solution: Verify your internet connection and API key validity. Check if the Groq service is operational.

JSON Validation Errors

Problem: API returns JSON validation errors
Solution: The application includes recovery mechanisms for these errors. Try reducing the complexity of your error description or enabling debug mode for more information.

No Solutions Found

Problem: The search returns no solutions
Solution: Try providing more detailed error information or specifying the SAP module and system version. Ensure you've entered a valid error message.

Session State Issues

Problem: The application doesn't remember your API key
Solution: Make sure to click "Save Configuration" after entering your API key. Try clearing your browser cache if issues persist.

Enabling Debug Mode
For persistent issues, enable Debug Mode in the Advanced Settings panel. This will display detailed error information that can help diagnose the problem or provide useful information when seeking support.
Example Use Cases
Scenario 1: Troubleshooting a Database Error
An SAP administrator encounters a DBIF_REPO_SQL_ERROR during a routine operation. By entering the error message and selecting the appropriate module, they receive specific guidance on checking database connections, resolving locking issues, and verifying SQL syntax in custom code.
Scenario 2: Resolving Material Document Processing Issues
A logistics user faces errors while processing material documents. The assistant identifies potential causes such as document locks, missing authorizations, or configuration issues, and provides transaction-specific resolution steps.
Scenario 3: Addressing Financial Posting Failures
A finance team member encounters errors when attempting financial postings. The assistant suggests checking fiscal year settings, verifying document type configurations, and examining posting period controls.
Limitations and Future Enhancements
Current Limitations

Solutions are generated based on AI interpretation and may require verification
Performance depends on the quality and specificity of the error information provided
Custom SAP implementations may require additional context for accurate solutions

Planned Enhancements

Integration with SAP notes database for reference-based solutions
Support for solution rating and feedback mechanisms
Expanded solution export options including PDF format
Direct integration with SAP system diagnostic tools

Legal and Privacy Considerations
This application processes SAP error information through the Groq API. While the application itself does not store error data beyond the current session (unless history saving is enabled), please be aware that data sent to external APIs may be subject to their privacy policies. Review Groq's privacy policy for details on how they handle data.
